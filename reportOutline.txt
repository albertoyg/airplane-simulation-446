PROJECT OUTLINE:
    simulation goals:
        What do we want to accomplish with our simulation?

    simulation parameters:
        What is subject to change with each simulation?

METHODOLOGY:
    simulation setup/initilization:
        How did you setup the simulations?

    data collection:
        How did we collect the stats?

    statistic visualization/evaluation:
        How are we going to evaluate the results?

RESULTS AND ANALYSIS:
    inividual runs:
        Show results for each run. 
        Is it what we expected? 

    grand statistic evaluation/comparison:
        What was the best and worst way to load the plane. Why? 

DISSCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:
    what we learned:
        What did we use from class and which out-of-course resourses did we use. Why? 

    insights and imporvments for next time:
        What were we limited to? 
        Why didn't we implement factors x, y, or z? 
        In a perfect world, what else would we have taken into account?
